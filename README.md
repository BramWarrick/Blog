Adding progress so far for ascii art page from homework. About to add Google App Engine Datastore
Users are written to db, and verifications pass
Removed large images from repo
Removed hr (rule) from index.html; reinstated index.html as landing page
# Added most log-in/out functionality
# Added 'like/dislike' functionality - uses POST :-(
# Formatted, most dead ends fixed. Consolidated EntryAdminHandler functions
# Minor housekeeping; deleted old templates
# added comments on blog.py; changed to user_curr for clarity
# Added comments to access.py
# Added comments to blog_entities.py
# Minor fixes after code hygiene run
# Added sorts to blog_entities.py functions that needed date sort
